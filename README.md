For Windows, follow https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows
USE NODE VERSION 16.12.0 due to Expo not supporting 17+ version (and you may have to use windows powershell in admin)
Install yarn (package manager): npm install yarn -g
Go into Froggie: cd some_path/Froggie
Run expo: yarn start (you may need to do yarn global add expo-cli if it gives you an error)
Download the expo app on your phone and scan the QR code
You should be good!
