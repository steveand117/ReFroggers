### 1. For Windows, follow https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows 
#### (USE NODE VERSION 16.12.0 due to Expo not supporting 17+ version (and you may have to use windows powershell in admin)
### 2. Install yarn (package manager): ```npm install yarn -g```
### 3. Go into Froggie: ```cd some_path/Froggie```
### 4. Run expo: ```yarn start``` (you may need to do ```yarn global add expo-cli``` if it gives you an error)
### 5. Download the expo app on your phone and scan the QR codes
### You should be good to go!
